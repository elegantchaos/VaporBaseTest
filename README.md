# VaporBaseTest

A test website based on the [VaporBase](https://github.com/elegantchaos/VaporBase) package.

[VaporBase](https://github.com/elegantchaos/VaporBase) defines the guts of a simple Vapor-based website, including user login/logout and basic profile management.

It leaves the actual model, appearance, etc of the website for the client package to define. This is an example of a client.
